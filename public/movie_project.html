<h1>Cassie's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time!</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Die Hard Series</h3>
<p>Great action films with some humor. It also stars my favorite actor Bruce Willis.<p>

<h3>Steel Magnolias</h3>
<p>The best movie to watch when you need a laugh and a good cry. Yes ladies, we have all been there!</p>

<h3>Little Mermaid</h3>
<p>The original animation, not the remake.  As a beach lover, it is fun to see a storyline of a world under the sea.</p>
