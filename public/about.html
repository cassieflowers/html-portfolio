<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Working in the Loyalty & Recognition incentive industry for 17+ years I am accustomed to working in fast paced environments with the ability to think quickly and successfully handle challenging clients. "Excellent" is often a word used to describe my interpersonal skills, ability to work well with others, in both supervisory or support staff roles. </p>

<p>I often prioritize and juggle multiple tasks with multiple interruptions; maintain confidentiality and practice excellent work ethics. I thrive with tight deadlines and am often complimented on my dedication to the company and most importantly, the clients. </p>

<p>Serving in customer service positions for 23+ years, it is a "no-brainer' that I posses verbal and written communication skills and excellent problem solving skills.</p>

<p>In 2019, I decided to begin the adventure of shifting from 'the business side' to be closer to the 'technical side'. While I don't develop code (yet), I took the skills I gathered throughout my professional career and applied them with a fresh perspective for improvement to the Loyalty product. I now focus on creating new ideas for the product, breaking project requirements down to write detailed user stories, facilitate & participate in agile scrum ceremonies, create and maintain the development backlog, product release process and schedule.</p>
